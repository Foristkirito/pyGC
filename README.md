# pyGC
 
> Non-parametric implementarion of Granger Causality in python based on Dhamala's paper "Estimating Granger causality from Fourier and wavelet transforms of time series data".

> This package contains the module pyGC contains the function wilson_factorization for factorizing spectral matrices based on the implementation by Nedungadi et. al., in Analyzing multiple spike trains with nonparametric granger causality (direct translation from their Matlab code), and the function granger_causality to compute the causal influences between two signal.
